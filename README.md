### Background information - Task1

The digital revolution and our fast-changing world requires a skills revolution. And it’s not just about the digital skills. The skills revolution is about helping people build their digital awareness, emotional intelligence and creativity to fully participate in the digital future workplace — and it needs to start now.

At PwC, we are working with other organisations across the world, building on our work with clients and on upskilling our 276,000 people. Still, more must be done if we are to ensure everyone has the opportunity to learn, work and participate in the digital world. This is at the heart of our purpose.

We are enabling employees who are motivated to further accelerate their skills to do so by offering them a “career pivot” to become what we call “Digital Accelerators”. Accelerators rapidly deepen their skills in digital specialties, such as data, automation, AI, and digital storytelling by learning a variety of self-service tools and coding languages and applying these skills across our business.

We are happy you joined us, welcome to the team! Giulia is your manager and helps you through your upskilling journey in PowerBI - your step to become a true data jedi and Digital Accelerator. But wait no more, word spreads fast and an important client reached out to you to help him visualising their data.

Possible KPIs include (to get you started, but not limited to):
- Overall customer satisfaction
- Overall calls answered/abandoned
- Calls by time
- Average speed of answer

### Background information - Task2

A few weeks after presenting your dashboard to the management, the Retention Manager from the telecom reaches out to you directly. He was impressed by your work and asked if you can put together a dashboard about customer retention.

In addition, to better understand the data, the telecom Retention Manager has scheduled a meeting with the engagement partner at PwC to cover these points:

- Customers in the telecom industry are hard-earned: we don’t want to lose them
- The retention department is here to get customers back in case of termination 
- Currently, we get in touch after they have terminated the contract, but this is reactionary: it would be better to know in advance who is at risk 
- We  have done customer analysis with Excel: it has always ended in a dead-end
- We would like to know more about our customers: visualised clearly so that it’s self-explanatory for our management

#### What to do
Your colleague, the engagement partner, asks you to do the following tasks:

- Define proper KPIs
- Create a dashboard for the retention manager reflecting the KPIs
- Write a short email to him (the engagement partner) explaining your findings, and include suggestions as to what needs to be changed

The Retentions Manager has provided some information, have a look below.

### Background information - Task3

Human Resources at our telecom client is highly into diversity and inclusion. They’ve been working hard to improve gender balance at the executive management level, but they’re not seeing any progress. They’re reaching out to us for help.

At PwC Switzerland we are often approached by clients seeking support with diversity and inclusion. Companies need a workforce of diverse talents and backgrounds to succeed in an increasingly complex and heterogeneous world. To us, diversity and inclusion are business imperatives, not just nice-to-haves. We aim for all of our teams to feel welcome and appreciated. But actually achieving this and unlocking its potential involves a whole set of practical challenges.

Why is this so?
Think about the importance of strategy, awareness and education, analytics and inspiration. 

Here is a hint: Calculating the following measures could help to define proper KPIs:

- num of men
- num of women
- num of leavers
- % employees promoted (FY21)
- % of women promoted
- % of hires men
- % of hires women
- % turnover 
- Average performance rating: men
- Average Performance rating: women

#### What to do

Your task is to do the following:

- Define relevant KPIs in hiring, promotion, performance and turnover, and create a visualisation
- Write what you think some root causes of their slow progress might be
